I don't know what Phattyoshis is. I don't know where it came from, but it was a word that popped into my head as a 13 year old skater looking for some way to describe doing a cool trick. That trick was phattyoshis. Haha, who would have ever thought that it would turn into my online handle and follow me around for the last 22 years.
